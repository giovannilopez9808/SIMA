     Daily average (reference) at site's altitude = 284.8 K
     Stratospheric Ozone and NO2 (effective) = 225.2 K

** WARNING #3*********
\\ The ozone columnar amount, 0.2400 atm-cm, is outside the most probable limits of 0.2425 and 0.4436
\\ for this altitude. This may produce inconsistent results.
\\ Suggestion: double check the values of IALT and AbO3 on input Card 5a.

** WARNING #13 *********
\\ Ground reflectance data for CONCRETE                
\\ extend only from 0.3000 to 1.3000 �m,
\\ whereas the wavelength limits for this run are 0.2850 and 2.8000 �m.
\\ Consequently, reflectance is fixed at 0.186 below 0.3000 �m and at 0.486 above 1.3000 �m.
