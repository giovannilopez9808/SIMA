  abstract = {Data from the annual, seasonal, and hourly behavior of the criteria air pollutants CO, NO2, SO2, O3, and PM10 in three Mexican metropolitan areas (the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA), Guadalajara Metropolitan Area (GMA), and Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA)) over the period 2000–2011 were analyzed;  and compliance with Mexican air quality standards was evaluated, highlighting causes of specific episodes of high and low concentrations. Data analyzed were collected from automatic air-monitoring networks located in the MCMA (32 stations), GMA (8 stations),  and MMA (5 stations). In the MCMA and MMA, correlations between wind direction and concentrations of SO2 suggest that there was a considerable contribution of trans-boundary transport from outside of these areas. Analysis of annual trends revealed large reductions of CO in the MCMA, and SO2 in the three metropolitan areas. However, the annual mean concentration of O3 increased by 47% and 42% in the GMA and MMA, respectively, from 2000 to 2011, but decreased by 13% in the MCMA from 2005 to 2010. The annual mean     concentration of PM10 in the MMA was about 58% and 76% higher than that in the MCMA and GMA, respectively, from 2001 to 2010.},

  abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) is both a major driver of climate change and a source of toxicity for health. In the upper atmosphere, particulate matter modifies the earth radiation budget, cloud formation and acts as a reaction center for air pollutants. In the lower atmosphere, particulate matter changes atmospheric visibility and alters biogeochemical cycles and meteorology. Most critical effects are observed in ambient air, where particulate matter degrades human health. Here we review the sources, spatial and temporal variability, and toxicity of PM10, the particulate matter having particle sizes 10 micrometers or less in diameter, in world regions. For that we analyzed information from the world wide web and databases from government organizations after the year 2000. Findings show that PM10 is a major risk in both developed and developing countries. This risk is more severe in Asian countries compared to Europe and USA, where decreasing trends are recorded during the last two decades. Meteorological factors modify particulate matter variations at local and regional levels. PM2.5/PM10 ratio provides information of particulate matter sources under different environment conditions. Crustal matter, road traffic and combustion of fuels are major sources of particulate matter pollution. Health studies indicate that long-term exposure to particulate matter has multiple health effects in people from all age groups. Identification of possible sources and their control with regular epidemiological monitoring could decrease the impact of particulate matter pollution.},

@article{Gueymard1995,
  abstract = {An upgraded spectral radiation model called SMARTS2 is introduced. The solar shortwave direct beam irradiance is calculated from spectral transmittance functions for the main extinction processes in the cloudless atmosphere: Rayleigh scattering, aerosol extinction, and absorption by ozone, uniformly mixed gases, water vapor, and nitrogen dioxide. Temperature-dependent or pressure-dependent extinction coefficients have been developed for all these absorbing gases, based on recent spectroscopic data obtained either directly from the experimental literature or, in a preprocessed form, from MODTRAN2, a state-of-the-art rigorous code. The NO2 extinction effect, in both the UV and visible, is introduced for the first time in a simple spectral model. Aerosol extinction is evaluated using a two-tier Angstr{\"{o}}m approach. Parameterizations of the wavelength exponents, single-scattering coefficient, and asymmetry factor for different aerosol models (proposed by Shettle and Fenn, Braslau and Dave, and also in the Standard Radiation Atmosphere) are provided as a function of both wavelength and relative humidity. Moreover, aerosol turbidity can now be estimated from airport visibility data using a function based on the Shettle and Fenn aerosol model. An improved approximation to the extraterrestrial solar spectrum, treated at 1 nm intervals between 280 and 1700 nm, and 5 nm intervals between 1705 and 4000 nm, is based on recent satellite data in the UV and visible. The total irradiance between 280 and 4000 nm (1349.5 W/m2) is obtained without scaling and is in good agreement with the currently accepted value of the solar constant (1367 W/m2). Incident diffuse radiation and global radiation for any plane orientation at ground level are also calculated by the model, with provision for both multiple scattering effects and ozone absorption intricacies in the UV. SMARTS2 also has an optional circumsolar correction function and two filter smoothing functions which together allow the simulation of actual spectroradiometers. This facilitates comparison between modelled results and measured data. Detailed performance assessment of the model is provided. It consists of prediction comparisons between the proposed model and rigorous radiative transfer models for different specific atmo- spheric conditions in the UV, visible, and near IR. High quality measured datasets in the UV and in the intervals 290–620 nm and 300–1100 nm are also used to validate the model by direct com- paris{\ldots}},
