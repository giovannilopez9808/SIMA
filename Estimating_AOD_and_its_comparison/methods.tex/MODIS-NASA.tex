\subsubsection{MODIS-NASA Data}
We download the data of Aerosol Optical Depth at 550 nm (AOD\textsubscript{550nm}) from NASAâ€™s satellite MODIS (\url{https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/}). The data is taken daily and with a spatial resolution of 1 Deg. We used the product MODIS-Aqua Aerosol Cloud Water Vapor Ozone Daily L3 Global 1Deg CMG (MYD08\_D3) and looked at two data sets: Deep Blue Combined Mean and Land and Ocean Mean.
